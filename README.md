## Welcome to Kattis Solutions

Solution to problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) in java, C++ and typescript.

**Everyone is free to learn and code**

---
*Notes
1. Java don't allow class name to start with digits. Problem IDs starting with digits are preceded by underscore(_). e.g. _2048.java instead of 2048.java

2. Some problems with low CPU time limit will be solved in C++. Sorry for this as it is impossible to do within enough time limit in Java. 

### Update on 12-11-2021

Today, I have finished porting almost all previous solutions to typescript language. After working ~2 year as an developer, I decided to see how I can improved over the coding. Please see the [README](ts/README.md) to know detail about ts solution folder.
