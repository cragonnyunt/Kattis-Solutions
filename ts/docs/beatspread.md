Lets say there are two numbers `x` and `y`. (`x > y`)

```
x + y = sum
x - y = difference

2x = sum + difference
2y = sum - difference

x = (sum + difference) / 2
y = (sum - difference) / 2
```

Invalid conditions

- sum is greater than difference
- sum and difference are not the same even/odd pair
