The problem can be solved by simplifying logic, that is, no matter the direction is, the moves are the same. If we can split and rotate the tiles array (4x4 array) into a single 1x4 array with direction to `left`, and rotate again and merge all together, we get the answer. 

First taking input into 4x4 multidimensional array. Then, accept the direction number. So, we got

```ts
tiles = [
    [2, 0, 0, 2],
    [4, 16, 8, 2],
    [2, 64, 32, 4],
    [1024, 1024, 64, 0],
]
direction = 2
```

Then `transpose` function is to rotate the face of tile, in the direction, moves to left. Now, we can loop each row and merge tiles to left.

```ts
// Direction (0) is Left
movedTiles = [
    [2, 0, 0, 2],
    [4, 16, 8, 2],
    [2, 64, 32, 4],
    [1024, 1024, 64, 0],
]
// Direction (1) is Up
movedTiles = [
    [2, 2, 4, 0],
    [0, 8, 32, 64],
    [0, 16, 64, 1024],
    [2, 4, 2, 1024],
]
// Direction (2) is Right
movedTiles = [
    [2, 0, 0, 2],
    [2, 8, 16, 4],
    [4, 32, 64, 2],
    [0, 64, 1024, 1024],
]
// Direction (3) is Down
movedTiles = [
    [1024, 2, 4, 2],
    [1024, 64, 16, 0],
    [64, 32, 8, 0],
    [0, 4, 2, 2],
]
```

`mergeTiles` works on single (1x4 dimensional array). It considers only moving tiles to the left side of the array. We can apply this function to each row of above rotated array.

```ts
// Direction (0) is Left
movedTiles = [
    [2, 0, 0, 2],
    [4, 16, 8, 2],
    [2, 64, 32, 4],
    [1024, 1024, 64, 0],
]
// After merging to left
movedTiles = [
    [4, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 16, 8, 2],
    [2, 64, 32, 4],
    [2048, 64, 0, 0],
]
```

When rotating back to original array, we can use the opposite direction to rotate array back for `UP` and `DOWN` direction. But we uses the same one, when the direction is `LEFT` or `RIGHT`. `LEFT` moves are already satisfied as no moves needs, `RIGHT` moves need to reverse each row as its direction.

When we chain these methods together, we can finally output the result array, and print it.

```ts
const movedTiles = transpose(tiles, dir).map(mergeTiles)
printTiles(transpose(movedTiles, getReverseDirection(dir)))
```
