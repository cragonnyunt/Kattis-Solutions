# wordsfornumbers

Replace the number in input with numbers, and capitalize the result string.

When replacing the number,

1) if number is less than 20, replace directly from mapping

2) if number is an multiplier of 10, replace directly from mapping

3) if number is not any of this condition, separate digits and get the mapping from above two step. And combine with separator `-`
