# plantingtrees

From the sample input 1,

```
2 3 4 3
```

We want the party to start as soon as possible, so plant the seed which takes the longest on the first day.

| Day | Seed | Grown At |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | 1 + 4 = 5 |
| 2 | 3 | 2 + 3 = 5 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 + 3 = 6 |
| 4 | 2 | 4 + 2 = 6 |

As all trees are fully grown at Day 6, the party can start at day 7.
