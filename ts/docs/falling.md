The equation states that 

```
n2^2 - n1^2 = D
(n2 + n1) * (n2 - n1) = D
```

`n2 + n1` and `n2 - n1` are the factors of `D`. Let them be `a` and `b`.

```
n2 + n1 = a
n2 - n1 = b

a + b = 2 * n2
a - b = 2 * n1

n2 = (a + b) / 2 
n1 = (a - b) / 2 
```

Since `a + b = 2 * n2`, the factor must be both even, or odd.
