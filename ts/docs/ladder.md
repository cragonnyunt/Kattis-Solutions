# ladder

Diagram be like

```
                   <-- height
                /|
               / |
              /  |
             /   |
            /    |
           /     |
degree -> /      | <-- 90 degree right angle
          --------

```

```
sin = Opposite / Hypotenuse
```

Since the ladder length = Hypotenuse, and Height = Opposite side of degree

```
Hypotenuse = Opposite / sin
```
